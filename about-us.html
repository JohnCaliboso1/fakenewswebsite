			<p> Hello, my name is John Caliboso and I am the founder of the website "Fake news."
			    I decided to create my own website to help develop peoples awareness to how severe 
			    fake news can be. In the past, I was unfortunetly a victim to fake news. Although it was 	
			    more of a family matter fake news, it still effected me mentally. I decieded to develop a 
			    website to help those who are ignorant to fake news or to those who do not know how to spot	
			    fake news and what to do when you caught someone spreading it.

			<h1>What we do as a team</h1>

			<p> As a team we try our best to help those who are ignorant to fake news so that they will never fall victim to it.
			    We try our best to show our audience how to identify fake news, fake news we have caught and documented ourselves
			    and what you should do once you caught an individual or a group spreading fake news. Firstly, to identify fake news,
			    there are 9 specific rules that are crucial for you to never fall for any fake news:
			    1. Assess the design of the website or newspaper you read the news from and see specific details about it such as the images or any annoying ads.
			    2. Try to identify the news outlet to see other cases they may have documented and see whether they were real or fake.
			    3. If you are reading the news from a website, please be sure to identify the web domain, typically fake news website would have dodgey web domain such as ".com.co"
			    4. Always check the about us section since it would helps show you the reader the background of the website.
			    5. Ask yourself whether the author is trustworthy and has other news that is legit.
			    6. See whether the news is one side, this would prove the news is fake since news would commonly refer to two sides of the story and not being biased.
			    7. Check for any spelling or grammar mistakes.
			    8. Check if the quotes and source within the news is from a legitimate indivudal rather than an annonymous source.
			    9. Now you should do your research and search other articles related the the news and see if there is any significant differences compared to the two.
