			<p> The founder was a victim to fake news back in 2017. He first thought that fake news wasn't real since believing in lies was stupid
			    however he fell for a fake news. He believed in the washington pizza shop being a pedophile sex ring base. He believed it to an extent 
			    however this is not an excuse, he fell for it and is now a victim to it. From this experience he now wants others to avoid the embarrasement that he went through himself.
