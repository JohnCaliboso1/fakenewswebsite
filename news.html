			<p> On a Sunday afternoon, December 4th 2016, in a pizza shop located in the northwestern Washington DC a shooting incident took place which was led by fake news. A man carrying a rifle 
			    walked into the store and started shooting. Fortunately, no one was injured and the man was shortly arrested. The pizza shop, 'Comet Ping Pong' was attacked due to false rumours on twitter
			    that it was the base for a pedophile sex ring invlovling the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. After the tweet was being widely spread, right wing activists started to harrass 
			    and threaten the store believing in the twitter claims about it being a pedophile sex ring base. The pizza shopo started to become frighten by more and more activists still believing in the fake news,
			    this then led to the shooting in the pizza shop by a 28-year-old man from North Carolina who claimed to do his own 'investigation.' According to New York Times, the 28-year-old man was known to be soft-spoken, polite individual
			    only wanting to rescue the 'children trapped in the shop.' Fake news is serious. Fake news led to a shop to live in fear from others in case anything would happen to them outside their work. Also,
			    fake news may lead to other people to commit crimes.

			<p> Since the start of COVID-19, there have been many fake news trying to exploit public fear and uncertainty about the pandemic
			    This would include the public to be fed misinformation, and disinformation. In terms of misinformation, within social media 
			    many form of misleading advice or statistic about COVID-19 was released to try keep the citizen from knowing the true extent of the pandamic
			    and the impact the pandemic actually has. This would be considered as a 'white lie' since it misleads information for the safety for the people
			    however this is still not good since it makes others to believe in fake news leaving them to stay ignorant. Fake news such as cures for COVID-19 spread around the social media
			    such as Twitter and YouTube. However these application have sought to remove such misleading information. We also have seen some disinformation aiming to cause disruption.
			    This is seen to be dangerous since the speed of fake news spreading during the pandemic is extremely fast resulting to a large amount of people belive these fake news.
